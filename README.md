# Examples for computational astrophysics

This repository contains examples, usable for the  computational astrophysics course by Philipp Moesta, based on the lecture notes by Michael Zingale. See https://pmoesta.github.io/computational_astrophysics/intro.html .

The examples are my own (ER); comments, corrections, requests for extras are all welcome.
